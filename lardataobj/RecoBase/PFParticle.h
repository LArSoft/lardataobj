  /**
   * @brief Hierarchical representation of particle flow
   *
   * The "Particle Flow" Particle is an object connecting to others of the
   * same type to define a hierarchy of a single parent generating multiple
   * daughter particles.
   *
   * This structure was originally proposed to accommodate the information
   * produced by Pandora. The PFParticle is a small entity that is expected
   * to be associated with `recob::Track`, `recob::Cluster`, `recob::Hit`,
   * `recob::Vertex` and also `recob::Seed` to describe all the reconstructed
   * quantities related to it.
   *
   * The parentage relationships are expressed by indices in the collection
   * all the particles belong to. This requires additional care when creating
   * that collection, since each relation is defined in the particles with
   * indices pointing to a collection that does not yet exist when the particle
   * is created.
   * The relation is expressed as one parent and many daughters. For "primary"
   * particles, which have no parent, the special parent value
   * `recob::PFParticle::kPFParticlePrimary` must be used.
   *
   * Note that the parentage relation can not be expressed as simple _art_
   * associations, which can't express relations between two objects of the
   * same type.
